This module adds two new fields, `requested_delivery_period_start` and `requested_delivery_period_end`
to both the `sale.order` and `sale.order.line` models. 

These fields allow you to capture the customer's expected delivery start and end dates, providing more precise tracking of delivery expectations within sales orders.
